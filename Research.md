**Full Research Being added soon, just organising and setting up the files from google docs, VS, and Easles**

Questions:
Control system: Command line
In the command line I have already set up a system?

 here. From the terrain project, though, you know that most of the tools that we use utilize 8-bit, signed integers (0-255) to represent color channel (R,G,B, and alpha) values.
This project will be rolled out in stages. Everything will be due by the due date, but we will have regular check-ins. 
The project developing a variety of image processing tools (Avenues Image Processor? AIP?):
a variety (minimum 3) of color to black and white conversion tools
a blurring tool
a color-dithering tool
a sharpening tool
an additional tool of your own choice (ideally, a convolution-based tool)
As well as:
(mandatory) the ability to undo changes or the ability to revert to the original image 
(optional) the ability to apply effects to subsections of the image
(optional) an interface to perform all of these things in (command line, app, p5/processing sketch, web page, etc.)
For now, create a GitHub repository called AIP, Unit 5, or something equally descriptive. Create a "research_notes.md" file to summarize the things you learn and create a "planning.md" file to make notes about how you will code all of this.
