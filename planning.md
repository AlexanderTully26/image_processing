# Planning & Instruction 

## Main Instructions:

You can learn about pixels

 here. From the terrain project, though, you know that most of the tools that we use utilize 8-bit, signed integers (0-255) to represent color channel (R,G,B, and alpha) values.
This project will be rolled out in stages. Everything will be due by the due date, but we will have regular check-ins. 
The project developing a variety of image processing tools (Avenues Image Processor? AIP?):
a variety (minimum 3) of color to black and white conversion tools.
- _a blurring tool
- a color-dithering tool
- a sharpening tool
- an additional tool of your own choice (ideally, a convolution-based tool)_
  
As well as:
- (mandatory) the ability to undo changes or the ability to revert to the original image 
- (optional) the ability to apply effects to subsections of the image
- (optional) an interface to perform all of these things in (command line, app, p5/processing sketch, web page, etc.)
- For now, create a GitHub repository called AIP, Unit 5, or something equally descriptive. Create a "research_notes.md" file to summarize the things you learn and create a "planning.md" file to make notes about how you will code all of this. 


## Grayscale: 
### Instructions:

Read about Grayscale Conversion (**[Links](https://tannerhelland.com/2011/10/01/grayscale-image-algorithm-vb6.html)**) to an external site. and update your research file to reflect what you have learned. 

Pick the three conversion techniques you will implement and add headings to your planning document for each, along with any notes you have about implementation. 

Implement the conversions. Ideally you do this one at a time by creating issues and/or branches. You could start by simply writing different programs for each conversion, but eventually you will need to unify all of the programs.

## Blurring:
### Instructions:

Read about Box Blur (**[Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_blur)**) to an external site. and add an implementation to your project.

## Color-dithering Tool:
### Instructions:
Read about F-S Dithering (**[Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering)**) to an external site. and add the functionality to your project. 

### Plan:




## Convolution Check-In
### Instructions:

If you've been having a feeling that blurring and dithering are pretty similar and wondering if there is something that can combine the two, then what you've been thinking about is something called "convolution." Read about here **[Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))** to an external site., then use what you've learned to implement sharpening and at least one-other convolution-based filter. 

A clever CS student would figure out a way to apply any convolution generically.
